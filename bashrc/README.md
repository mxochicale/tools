# .bashrc 

## Adding aliases and functions to .bashrc file 
```
cd 
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mxochicale/tools/master/bashrc/append_tools_to_bashrc.bash
```
Alternatively, you can use a bashrc that use ollama functions (which is really experimental). 
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mxochicale/tools/master/bashrc/append_tools_to_bashrc_with_ollama_commands.bash
```

* Append lines to bashrc:
```
bash append_tools_to_bashrc.bash
```

* Reload bashrc file
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

* Remove bash file
```
rm append_tools_to_bashrc.bash
```
```
