# My Collection Of Scientific/Engineering Tools :wrench: :nut_and_bolt: :books:
In this repository, I register various tools that I have been using in this journey of becoming not only a better scientist but also I guess a better engineer. One quote that summarises this repo is:
## _The tools we use have profound (and devious!) influence on our thinking habits, and therefore, on our thinking abilities_
~ [Edsger W.Dijkstra. 1975. How do we tell truths that might hurt?](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/ewd498.html)

## Clone repository
After generating your SSH keys as suggested [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) or [here](https://github.com/mxochicale/tools/blob/main/github/SSH.md) with few extra notes.
