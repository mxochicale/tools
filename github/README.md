## Why I am using GitHub?
In 2013 I was a research internship at [INAOE Robotic's Lab](http://ccc.inaoep.mx/grupos/robotica.php)
for six months where I played with Markovito, a patrol service robot and some accelerometers
to create a [DANCE DEMO Human-Robot Interaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw-lZam_qZI).
In the search for algorithms that can identify complex activities such as 
dancing, I found the [GitHub repository of Jordan Frank](https://github.com/jwf/tdetools).
Such discovery blew my mind away as all the code was open accessible (e.g. C++, R, python, etc) 
which then allows me to replicate some of Frank's work.
I guess that was the starting point when I thought of starting my adventures with the use of [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub).
I was keeping marvelled to various open accessed projects in GitHub for about two years to then decided to join GitHub on March 8, 2015.
Then, by April 10, 2018, pretty much three years after join GitHub, I feel 
that I am very far away to use the full potential of GitHub. 
So, I am still learning from all the GitHub community. 

Perhaps, a stronger reason to use GitHub is the following extract of 
 [Gousios et al. 2014](/references/lean-ghtorrent.pdf)

> "During recent years, [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub),
founded in 2008, has become the largest code host in the world, with more
than 5M developers collaborating across 10M repositories.
Due to its support for distributed
version control (Git) and pull-based development [2], as well as
its modern Web UI and focus on social coding [ [4] ](/references/dabbish-cscw2012.pdf),
GitHub has quickly surpassed
in size and popularity even much older forges such as Sourceforge (1999).
GitHub offers a tremendous research potential. For instance, it is
a flagship for current open source development, a place for developers to
showcase their expertise to peers or potential recruiters, and
the platform where social coding features or pull requests emerged."
