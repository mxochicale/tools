## 4. ISO and USB selection

It's likely that both your Ubuntu ISO and the correct USB device will have been 
detected and set as ‘Source disc image' and ‘Disk to use' in the application window. 
If not, use the ‘Other' button to locate your ISO file and select the exact USB 
device you want to use from the list of devices.

Click Make Startup Disk to start the process.

## 5. Confirm USB device

Before making any permanent changes, you will be asked to confirm the USB 
device you've chosen is correct. 
This is important because any data currently stored on this device will be destroyed.

# (B) Boot from USB flash drive

Most computers will boot from USB automatically. Simply insert the 
USB flash drive and either power on your computer or restart it. 
You should see the same welcome window we saw in the previous 
Install from DVD step, prompting you to choose your language 
and either install or try the Ubuntu desktop.

If your computer does not automatically boot from USB, try holding 
F12 when your computer first starts. With most machines, this will 
allow you to select the USB device from a system-specific boot menu.

F12 is the most common key for bringing up your systems boot menu, 
but Escape, F2 and F10 are common alternatives. 
If you are unsure, look for a brief message when your system 
starts - this will often inform you of which key to press to 
bring up the boot menu.
